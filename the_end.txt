Darkness:
I had a dream, which was not all a dream.
The bright sun was extinguish'd, and the stars
Did wander darkling in the eternal space,
Rayless, and pathless, and the icy earth
Swung blind and blackening in the moonless air;
Morn came and wentâ€”and came, and brought no day,
And men forgot their passions in the dread
Of this their desolation.
